# Secure Authentication Project
> Benzon Carlitos Salazar

## Overview
In this project, you are tasked with simulating a simple user registration  and authentication program. 
Security is critical in this application. Users will have a username and a password. 
These must be stored securely so that an attacker would be unable to hijack accounts 
even if they gain access to the database (represented as a text file).

Since security is critical for this application, classical ciphers will not suffice.  In order to securely store our sensitive information, we must use a **modern cipher**.  Suggestions include (but are not limited to):
* [x] RSA
* [ ] DES
* [x] AES
* [ ] Triple-DES

## My implementation
Two Cryptosystems are individually implemented to practice my ciphers -- 
***AES*** and ***RSA***.
